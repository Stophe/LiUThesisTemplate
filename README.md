# LiU thesis LaTeX template

## About the template
This is a Linköping University LaTeX template. In its current form it is very crude, but functional. Only IFM version is available at the moment.

The template is designed to use the XeLaTeX compiler in order to handle input of exotic character such as the swedish characters åäö. If you (for some reason) don't want to use XeLaTeX, you can use:
```latex
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
```

## Contributers
Many have contributed to the code as it has been passed down from student to student over the years.
